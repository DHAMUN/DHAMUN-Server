## About

This is a prototype DHAMUN web server. This is only the server, however. It is part of a bigger, 3 component application, which will include the following

```
a) A web client (another repo)
b) A server (this repo)
c) A mobile app (coming soon)
```

This is going to be a server that handles various requests from the client and the mobile app.
Look at the about repo for all the awesome upcoming features.
